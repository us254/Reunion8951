## Cloudflare Worker Deployment

To deploy the following JavaScript code on Cloudflare Worker and access its configuration, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Cloudflare Worker using the Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Copy and paste the provided JavaScript code into the worker script.
3. Deploy the worker.

```javascript
https://github.com/3Kmfi6HP/EDtunnel/blob/main/_worker.js
```

4. After deployment, note down the worker address (e.g., `https://workerdomain/uuid`).

5. Create a JSON configuration using the obtained worker address:

```json

  "workerdomain/uuid",
  

```

6. Replace `"https://workerdomain/uuid"` with the actual worker address.

7. Use this JSON configuration as needed in your application.

### Modifying UUID and Address in JavaScript Worker Code

1. Open the JavaScript worker code file.

2. Locate the section of code where the UUID is defined. It might look like this:
   
   ```javascript
   const uuid = "your_current_uuid_here";


Remember to replace `https://workerdomain/uuid` with the actual worker address you obtained during deployment.
```

Please replace `"https://workerdomain/uuid"` with the actual worker address you receive after deploying the Cloudflare Worker. This Markdown text provides you with step-by-step instructions on deploying the JavaScript code on Cloudflare Worker and utilizing the worker's address in a JSON configuration.
