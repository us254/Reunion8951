## Cloudflare Worker Deployment

To deploy the following JavaScript code on Cloudflare Worker and access its configuration, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Cloudflare Worker using the Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Copy and paste the provided JavaScript code into the worker script.
3. Deploy the worker.

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  // Your code logic here
  // Fetch and process data
  // Return response
}
```

4. After deployment, note down the worker address (e.g., `https://workerdomain/uuid`).

5. Create a JSON configuration using the obtained worker address:

```json
{
  "workerAddress": "https://workerdomain/uuid",
  "otherConfigKey": "otherConfigValue"
}
```

6. Replace `"https://workerdomain/uuid"` with the actual worker address.

7. Use this JSON configuration as needed in your application.

Remember to replace `https://workerdomain/uuid` with the actual worker address you obtained during deployment.
```

Please replace `"https://workerdomain/uuid"` with the actual worker address you receive after deploying the Cloudflare Worker. This Markdown text provides you with step-by-step instructions on deploying the JavaScript code on Cloudflare Worker and utilizing the worker's address in a JSON configuration.
