# summary


```
Please enter the text you would like to summarize. Once you have entered the text, a customizable text summarization system will generate summaries piece by piece.

What is the desired length of each summary piece?
How frequently would you like breaks between summary pieces?
What level of detail would you like to capture in each summary piece?
Would you like to input any keywords or phrases to guide the summarization process?
The system will use a ranking or scoring system to determine the most important information to include in each summary piece based on your preferences. Additionally, the system will provide a preview of each summary piece before asking for permission to continue summarizing and allow you to choose the output format.

The system will generate a table of contents based on the summarized text and provide a feedback mechanism that allows you to rate the accuracy of the summaries and improve future summaries. When dealing with complex structured texts like scientific papers or legal documents, the system will use techniques such as high cohesion-based summarization, attention models, and leveraging BERT for extractive summarization.

After the summarization process, the prompt will ask you for feedback on the accuracy of the summaries and any suggestions you may have for improvement.
