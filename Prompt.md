# ChatGPT  Prompt Improvement

`Read all of the instructions below and once you understand them say "Shall we begin:"   I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process: Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.   Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections.   Revised Prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you) Suggestions (provide 3 suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it) Questions (ask the 3 most relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt)   At the end of these sections give me a reminder of my options which are:   Option 1: Read the output and provide more info or answer one or more of the questions Option 2: Type "Use this prompt" and I will submit this as a query for you Option 3: Type "Restart" to restart this process from the beginning Option 4: Type "Quit" to end this script and go back to a regular ChatGPT session   If I type "Option 2", "2" or "Use this prompt" then we have finsihed and you should use the Revised Prompt as a prompt to generate my request If I type "option 3", "3" or "Restart" then forget the latest Revised Prompt and restart this process If I type "Option 4", "4" or "Quit" then finish this process and revert back to your general mode of operation We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised Prompt section until it is complete.`

`INTRODUCTIONS The introduction paragraph has 2 sections: General Sentences Thesis Statement General Sentences: Must be the FIRST part of your introduction. Must include background information to inform the reader about the essay topic. Must refer to the topic and explain why it is important. Must NOT include any arguments, personal opinions or information that requires evidence from source texts. Thesis Statement: Must introduce an opposing argument (this is important as it will be discussed in Block 1) Must clearly show your position on the topic of the essay (For or Against). Must paraphrase the essay question (topic), so it uses different language. (You should attempt to do this in your AT1 timed essay, but it is not essential) Must include a sub-topic that will be the main argument you discuss in your Block 2 paragraph. The thesis statement is the most important sentence in your whole essay - all of the arguments you make in your essay must support your thesis and link to it, so you must make sure that it: is clear in its grammar (it makes sense as a sentence and can be easily understood) AND is clear in how it shows your position on the issue (it clearly shows what you will be arguing in your essay) Remember to punctuate your work properly, look out for sentence structure errors in your writing, and use the correct register. Do not use first person personal pronouns (I think... I believe...) to give your argument in your thesis statement. BLOCK 1 PARAGRAPH The Block 1 paragraph has 2 sections: Opposing Argument Rebuttal Opposing Argument: Must be introduced in the TOPIC SENTENCE at the BEGINNING of the paragraph. This TOPIC SENTENCE must include what the opposing argument is and state who believes/supports it. The opposing argument must be followed by supporting details that try to prove that argument. It is good to use supporting details from source materials. Remember to include an in-text citation for any material you use from sources - whether it is a direct quotation, paraphrase or summary. Remember this is an opposing argument - it is NOT YOUR argument - this should be clear when reading it. Rebuttal: Must begin with an appropriate transition signal or phrase. Must contain a counter argument that links to the opposing argument (not just any different argument). This counter argument must show how/why the opposing argument is wrong. If it does not do this, it is not a counter argument. The counter argument must be followed by supporting details that prove that argument. It is good to use supporting details from source materials to make your counter argument as strong as possible. Remember to include an in-text citation for any material you use from sources - whether it is a direct quotation, paraphrase or summary. Remember to punctuate your work properly, look out for sentence structure errors in your writing, and use the correct register. Do not use personal pronouns (I think... I believe...) to give your arguments/opinions. BLOCK 2 PARAGRAPH Your Block 2 paragraph has this simple structure with the following important points to remember: Topic Sentence: Begins with an appropriate transition word or phrase Includes a clear controlling idea that shows the main argument that the paragraph will discuss Supporting Point: Makes a point that supports the topic sentence. It must link to the topic sentence and show how/why the topic sentence is correct. Supporting Detail: Can be an example, facts/statistics or expert opinion from source material. It must link to the supporting point and show how/why the supporting point is correct. Remember to include an in-text citation for any material you use from sources - whether it is a direct quotation, paraphrase or summary. CONCLUSION The Conclusion paragraph contains 4 important elements that must be present: Transition Restate your position Summarise your main arguments Final comment AA Transition: Must be appropriate for a conclusion and be used at the BEGINNING of the paragraph. Make sure it has proper punctuation. Restate your position: Write the position from your introduction thesis statement in different words. If you copy the same words again or just change one or two words, you will lose marks - this is how many students lose most of the marks for their conclusion in the AT1 Essay. Make sure you are only restating the position (what you will argue in the essay) and not the other elements of the thesis statement (opposing argument and sub-topics). This should be the first sentence in your conclusion. You will lose marks if it is not. Summarise your Main Argument: This is the argument shown in the topic sentence of your Block 2 paragraph. (You can also include your counterargument from block 1) This summary must be written in different words to how the argument was written in Block 2. If you copy the same words again or just change one or two words, you will lose marks You can summarise the main argument in one complex or compound sentence, or you can split it into 2 sentences. The important thing is that it must be a clear and accurate summary of your main argument. Final Comment: This is the final part of your conclusion, and the whole essay. It can be a call to action, a recommendation, a warning of the consequences of not following your thesis, or a general statement about how people or the community would benefit from following your thesis. IMPORTANT - Be aware of the rules of academic register in this element of the conclusion - it is common for students to start using informal language and personal pronouns (I, my, mine) here to express their thoughts - you must ensure you express your final comment in academic register. You must not use source material in the conclusion paragraph. You are ONLY allowed to use sources in BLOCK 1 and BLOCK 2 paragraphs. In the conclusion, you should not introduce any new ideas or opinions - you are simply concluding what you have already argued earlier in your essay.`

# Self-Consistency

Consider the following multi-step reasoning problem:

**Question:** If a store has 10 apples and 8 oranges, and it sells 6 apples and 4 oranges, how many fruits are left in the store?

**Chain of Thought:**
- The store has 10 apples.
- The store sells 6 apples.
- The store has 4 apples left.
- The store has 8 oranges.
- The store sells 4 oranges.
- The store has 4 oranges left.
- The store has 4 + 4 = 8 fruits left.

**Self-Consistency:**
The model generates two thought chains for this problem. The first thought chain is shown above. The second thought chain is the same, except that the order of the steps is reversed.

The model then evaluates both thought chains and selects the one that is most consistent with the evidence. In this case, both thought chains are consistent, so the model selects the first thought chain as the final answer.

# Problem Analysis and Learning (PAL)

To illustrate how PAL works, let's consider the following problem:

The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. How many loaves of bread did they have left?

A traditional approach to solving this problem would be to use a chain-of-thought prompt. This would involve generating a sequence of text that describes the steps involved in solving the problem. For example, the following chain-of-thought prompt could be used to solve the above problem:

1. What is the total number of loaves of bread that the bakers baked?
2. What is the number of loaves of bread that the bakers sold in the morning?
3. What is the number of loaves of bread that the bakers sold in the afternoon?
4. What is the number of loaves of bread that the grocery store returned?
5. What is the total number of loaves of bread that the bakers have left?

The LLM would then be asked to generate a response to each prompt. The responses would then be combined to form a final answer. In this case, the final answer would be 74.

The PAL approach is different. Instead of generating a chain-of-thought prompt, the PAL approach generates a code prompt. A code prompt is a sequence of text that describes the steps involved in solving the problem, but it also includes code that can be executed by a runtime environment. For example, the following code prompt could be used to solve the above problem:

```python
def solve(baked_loaves, sold_in_morning, sold_in_afternoon, returned_loaves):
  total_sold = sold_in_morning + sold_in_afternoon
  total_loaves = baked_loaves - total_sold + returned_loaves
  return total_loaves

print(solve(200, 93, 39, 6))
```

The LLM would then be asked to generate a response to this prompt. The response would be a Python code snippet that implements the `solve()` function. The `solve()` function would then be executed by a Python interpreter, and the output of the function would be returned. In this case, the output of the function would be 74.

# Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Complex Reasoning

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps. You can combine it with few-shot prompting to get better results on more complex tasks that require reasoning before responding.

## Prompt:

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 4, 8, 9, 15, 12, 2, 1.

**A:** Adding all the odd numbers (9, 15, 1) gives 25. The answer is False.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 17, 10, 19, 4, 8, 12, 24.

**A:** Adding all the odd numbers (17, 19) gives 36. The answer is True.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 16, 11, 14, 4, 8, 13, 24.

**A:** Adding all the odd numbers (11, 13) gives 24. The answer is True.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 17, 9, 10, 12, 13, 4, 2.

**A:** Adding all the odd numbers (17, 9, 13) gives 39. The answer is False.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. 

**A:**
Output:

Adding all the odd numbers (15, 5, 13, 7, 1) gives 41. The answer is False.

Wow! We can see a perfect result when we provided the reasoning step. In fact, we can solve this task by providing even fewer examples, i.e., just one example seems enough:

# Using Special Symbols

When you are summarizing or extracting information from text, you will often need to enter large paragraphs of text, or even multiple paragraphs of text. Here is a little trick that can help you improve the accuracy of AI feedback:

- Use triple backticks (''') to separate instructions from text.
- You can use other special characters like (*), (/), (;), (#), (```), etc.
-"To present codes and computer commands, it is recommended to enclose them in a code block or code fence, also known as a code snippet, code section, preformatted text, or syntax highlighting block."

# Review
```
Review your previous answer and find problems with your answer.

Based on the problems you found, improve your answer. If there are no more problems with your answer, respond 'Complete'.

# For a tutor that draws his main wisdom from my favorite geniuses:

`You are a friendly, supportive, and knowledgeable tutor AI. Your main goal is to guide and educate younger colleagues and students who are looking to improve their knowledge and advance their careers. In your conversations, you should aim to identify their strengths and weaknesses, provide advice and resources for improvement, and foster a supportive, non-judgmental, and helpful environment. You should help them in setting their career goals, making strategic plans, learning new skills, overcoming challenges, and achieving success. You draw your wisdom and teaching style from a diverse array of influential thinkers: Adam Grant's approach to generosity and originality, Jeffrey Pfeffers insights into power dynamics and organizational behavior, Robert Sutton's work on managing workplace dynamics, Jordan Peterson's views on personal responsibility and the pursuit of meaning, Peter Druckers management philosophy, and Noam Chomskys and Erich Fromms ethical and moral perspectives. Despite your vast knowledge, you cannot remember past conversations, so every interaction should stand on its own. The interaction should be as natural as possible, so you are encouraged to engage in active listening, respond empathetically, ask probing questions, and provide detailed explanations as needed.` 


I personally find the responses excellent, simply amazing. Now feed it with information from a large corporation and not only your onboarding experience will be super easy plus you have a personal buddy available 24x7 for each employee. With Azure GPT4-32K are plenty of tokens available. In case this is still not enough, you could have multiple tutors for various areas and let them (the tutors) talk to each other via langchain agents. That would be really super cool.  I might need that the company I'm working with so might give it a try.
