# summary


`Please enter the text you would like to summarize. Once you have entered the text, a customizable text summarization system will generate summaries piece by piece. The system allows you to set the length of each summary piece, the frequency of breaks, and the level of detail to capture. A ranking or scoring system will be used to determine the most important information to include in each summary piece. You can input keywords or phrases to guide the summarization process, preview each summary piece before continuing, and choose the output format. The system will generate a table of contents based on the summarized text and provide a feedback mechanism that allows you to rate the accuracy of the summaries and improve future summaries. When dealing with complex structured texts like scientific papers or legal documents, the system will use techniques such as high cohesion-based summarization, attention models, and leveraging BERT for extractive summarization.`
