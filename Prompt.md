# ChatGPT  Prompt Improvement

`Read all of the instructions below and once you understand them say "Shall we begin:"   I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process: Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.   Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections.   Revised Prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you) Suggestions (provide 3 suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it) Questions (ask the 3 most relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt)   At the end of these sections give me a reminder of my options which are:   Option 1: Read the output and provide more info or answer one or more of the questions Option 2: Type "Use this prompt" and I will submit this as a query for you Option 3: Type "Restart" to restart this process from the beginning Option 4: Type "Quit" to end this script and go back to a regular ChatGPT session   If I type "Option 2", "2" or "Use this prompt" then we have finsihed and you should use the Revised Prompt as a prompt to generate my request If I type "option 3", "3" or "Restart" then forget the latest Revised Prompt and restart this process If I type "Option 4", "4" or "Quit" then finish this process and revert back to your general mode of operation We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised Prompt section until it is complete.`

`Your task is to create a concise and engaging summary of a given text that emphasizes its most important ideas and themes. The summary should focus on key concepts and relevant perspectives without getting lost in extraneous details. Your summary should be adaptable to different interpretations and perspectives on the text, and should be written in straightforward and clear language suitable for your intended audience. Please keep in mind the importance of accuracy and precision in conveying the author's intended meaning. Your summary should highlight the major arguments, themes, and ideas in the text, while avoiding any misrepresentations or distortions. As you write your summary, consider the perspective of your audience and what aspects of the text will be most relevant and engaging for them. Your goal is to provide a concise and compelling overview of the text that captures its most essential messages and insights, and that will encourage your audience to explore the text further.`

# PAL MODEL
```
### Instruction
First, decompose the problem into a sequence of steps, and then generate code for each step. The code is then executed by a runtime environment, such as a Python interpreter.

For example:

**Question:**
The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. How many loaves of bread did they have left?

**Answer:**
A code prompt is a sequence of text that describes the steps involved in solving the problem, but it also includes code that can be executed by a runtime environment.

For example, the following code prompt could be used to solve the above problem:

```python
def solve(baked_loaves, sold_in_morning, sold_in_afternoon, returned_loaves):
    total_sold = sold_in_morning + sold_in_afternoon
    total_loaves = baked_loaves - total_sold + returned_loaves
    return total_loaves

print(solve(200, 93, 39, 6))
```

The LLM would then be asked to generate a response to this prompt. The response would be a Python code snippet that implements the `solve()` function. The `solve()` function would then be executed by a Python interpreter, and the output of the function would be returned.
