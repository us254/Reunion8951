`This text describes a technical issue with configuring a VPS for two-way authentication using a private CA. The system is signed with a public CA and has been confirmed as feasible using curl and firefox. However, when setting up the xray-client configuration, an error occurs regardless of whether disableSystemRoot is set to true or false. Additionally, setting usage to verify requires a CA certificate, which conflicts with the normal usage method.

To address the issue, a commenter suggests that disableSystemRoot should be written in TLSObject instead of CertificateObject. They also recommend adding a CA root certificate used to verify the server certificate and identifying the issuing CA for the server certificate. Error logs are needed for further analysis.

Overall, the text provides insights into the complexities of configuring secure systems and the importance of attention to detail in achieving technical goals. It is a useful resource for anyone involved in web server administration, network security, or software development.`
