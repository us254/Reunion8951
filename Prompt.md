# summary

```Build a customizable summarization system that generates summaries piece by piece, enabling users to set the length of each piece, the frequency of breaks, and the level of detail to capture. The system should use a ranking or scoring system to determine the most important information to include in each summary piece and allow the user to input keywords or phrases to guide the summarization process. The system should provide a preview of each summary piece before asking for permission to continue summarizing and allow the user to choose the output format. Additionally, the system should include a feature that generates a table of contents based on the summarized text and allows the user to provide feedback on the accuracy of the summaries to improve future summaries.```
